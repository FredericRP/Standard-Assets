# Asset Bundle Tool

A simple local loader for asset bundles and an editor window that allows to export AssetBundles from unity.

## Usage

2. Open the asset bundle editor window from "Assets / FredericRP/ Asset Bundle Build"
3. Select the output directory
4. Click on Export button to create the asset bundles
5. Move them to the StreamingAssets root folder

Remote bundles will be managed in a future release.
