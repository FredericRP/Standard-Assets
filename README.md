# Standard-Assets

Useful code assets for your games projects. Those assets are an update of assets used in my former video games XP used to release games on PC, Mobiles and Switch(c).

# How to use

## Installation

### Using submodules
You can import the whole project as a submodule in a unity project.
From your usual git interface or command line, just add the submodule in a subfolder of the Assets/ folder by using its URL (click on the green *code* button to get it).

### Using unity package

1. Import the package: download the latest from the **Releases** section here on [github.com/FredericRP/Standard-Assets/releases](https://github.com/FredericRP/Standard-Assets/releases)
2. Some assets have a demo scene under their own *"Sample"* subfolder. Open those scenes to get a demo of how it works.
3. All assets have a *README* file, but you also have everything documented in this file.


## Available packages
Each package can be found in its sub folder:

- [Asset bundle tool](https://github.com/FredericRP/Standard-Assets/tree/primary/AssetBundleTool)
- [Bucket (or bean bag) generator](./tree/primary/BucketGenerator)
- [Event management](./tree/primary/EventManagement)
- [Object pool and its inspector](./tree/primary/ObjectPool)
- [Popups manager](./tree/primary/Popup)
- [Screen transitions](./tree/primary/ScreenTransitions)
- [Generic Singleton](./tree/primary/Singleton)
- [Tips display](./tree/primary/Tips)

# That's all folks !

Thanks for downloading this unity package, I hope this one will be added to your favorites one. Those assets saved us a lot of time when we developed games for clients and gamers, and hopefully it will do the same to you.
