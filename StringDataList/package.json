  "description": "Let say you want to allow your designer to edit some string properties in your project (you, fool) but there are only a limited amount of allowed strings, like characters names, seasons or anything, and for whatever reason, you don't want or cannot use enums.
Or maybe you have a list of data, and you don't want to have a name property of each data nor you want the list to display -Element 0-, -Element 1-, but instead you want to use your own names: for instance Cat, dog, unicorn...

This is the asset for you.",
